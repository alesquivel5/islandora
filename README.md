# islandora
Galvin Library Islandora migration scripts

dc_to_mods (both versions) and mods_iitmetadata_combine for preprocessing batch ingests of files migrating from DSpace.

mods_to_dc_subjectsplit replaces Islandora's default mods_to_dc XSL written by Library of Congress which creates Dublin Core from MODS XML.
